## What's Lox

Lox is a dynamically typed, interpreted script language, which is designed by Robert Nystorm for his book [*Crafting interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## What's rustlox

A virtual machine(VM) for the Lox programming language implemented in Rust. The original book utilizes C to build the VM, referred to as `clox`. To maintain consistency, I chose the name `rustlox` for the Rust implementation.
